This is a project for the completion of a Masters Program at
the National College of Ireland.
The project is a mobile web application that allows for participants
at conference events (or any kind of event) to find fellow
participants to collaborate with based on a profile matching
algorithm.
Usage. To set up an event goto http://geomingle.appspot.com.
Enter the location of the event using the google map facility.
This needs to be accurate as the mobile web app uses the location
of the user and matches it against the geo location of the event. The
user can drag and drop the location if the address input is not accurate.
The application allows the user to printout QR codes with the urls of
the event and the mobile web app embedded. The application requires the
user to have a gmail account.
The mobile application works by going to http://geomingle.appspot.com/geo.
The application requires the user to have a facebook account. When the
user is within the vicinity of an event entered by the above process and
for a relevant date, the user will see the event listed in the application.
By clicking on the event they are then checked in to the event. They can then
find fellow participants by clicking on the make contact button. A profile
matching algorithm will list contacts with relevant profiles. The application then
allow the participants to make contact via a chatting facility.
